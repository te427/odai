      <p>Hi, welcome to my website.</p>
      <p>
        I'm a Software Engineer at Google, where I work on UI's for Google's
        Fuchsia OS. Previously I worked for Activision Blizzard helping to 
        build online services for Call of Duty, Diablo and a few other games.
      </p>
      <p>
        I enjoy half-finishing projects to try out new code, visualizations,
        front end focused full stack development, and the human side of programming.
        In my spare time I enjoy fantasy in any medium, playing around in the kitchen,
        and reading books that are dry and academic, mostly.
      </p>
      <p>You can find my details on the left.</p>

        Now I know in part, but then shall I know, even as also I am known.
